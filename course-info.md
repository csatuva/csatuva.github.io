Required materials, basic descriptions, and helpful resources for CS classes

## Generally Helpful Stuffs

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/): crash courses in a wide variety of programming languages and tools
- [C++ to assembly viewer](http://godbolt.org/): a former 2150 TA suggested this for use in labs (GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr/issues/180)), but there's no word from Prof. Bloomfield on it yet. A useful tool for exploratory purposes, but please refrain from using it to complete course assignments.
- [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc): you will need to use GitHub at least minimally for several classes; this manual covers all the operations you'll need

## CS 111x

- Languages: Java or Python (dependent on class)
- Platform: your choice
- Tools: [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (dependent on class)
    - there is an education discount for Pycharm you'll need to use

Intro CS course. Intro to programming and basic CS concepts.

## CS 2110

- Languages: Java
- Platform: your choice
- Tools: [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
- Course materials: *is there a textbook?*

AKA: CS 2. Somewhat of an extension of 111x, plus a small team project.

## CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation

- Languages: C++
- Platform: Unix-based (so not Windows)
- Tools: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), or dual boot
- Course materials: [Course GitHub repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr)

2150 is a prerequisite for most 3xxx and 4xxx CS courses; most students find it fairly challenging. Allocate several more hours per week for 2150 than you would for other courses. It would be highly beneficial to [learn C++](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/) and get comfortable with a Unix terminal *before* you start this course.

## CS / ECE 2330 - Digital Logic Design

(the CS and ECE versions are the same class; sign up for whichever is available)

- Languages: n/a
- Platform: your choice
- Tools: [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a small logic circuit simulation program
- Course materials: [Digital Design with RTL Design, VHDL, and Verilog 2nd Edition (Vahid)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470531088/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This class studies elementary circuit components (hardware); it's different from most other CS courses.

## CS 3240 - Advanced Software Development

- Languages / frameworks: Python, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), some very basic SQL
- Platform: your choice
- Tools: [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Course materials: *is there a textbook?*

## CS 3330 - Computer Architecture

- Languages: C (not C++)
- Platform: your choice(?), but Unix-based will probably be easier
- Tools: a few small CLIs provided throughout the semester
- Course materials: [course website](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/3330/F2016/index.html), [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 3rd Edition (Bryant & O'Hallaron)](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483286958&sr=1-1&keywords=computer+systems+a+programmer%27s+perspective) (the edition is important)

This course studies the very lowest levels of instructions (machine code / assembly). Most students find it challenging; the material can be somewhat tedious. Allocate a few more hours per week than you think you'll need.

## CS 4970 / 4971 - Capstone Practicum I / II

- Languages / frameworks: [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (team preference)
- Platform: your choice
- Tools: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (optional)
- Course materials: [Course GitHub site](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/README.html)

AKA: Service Learning Practicum (SLP). Students work in teams to develop real, usable software for local non-profits.
