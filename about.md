This is the unofficial site for students in the Computer Science department at the University of Virginia. It currently contains information about CS courses; we plan to add pages for student organizations and ongoing research.

If you have suggestions or would like to contribute to the site, please contact one of the organization admins (Hudson Burgess, Andrew Norton, Sam Havron) via our Slack channel.
